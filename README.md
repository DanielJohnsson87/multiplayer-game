# Multiplayer Game (Or maybe just a game, we'll see ü§ì) 

I'm playing around building a multiplayer game. Probably something similar to [Videoball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/277390/VIDEOBALL/). But things might change during the project. I'm building this mostly to explore game development.


### Getting up and running üë®‚Äçü¶Ω

The main app is broken at the moment. The frontend has changed a lot since I wrote the backend, so the game is unable to start. It's best to run the `debugCollisions` entry instead.

```
yarn debugCollisions
```

### Project definition

The project definition is very loose at the moment. I want to create a multiplayer game of some sort. When writing this the [Quake III Network model/architecture](https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/network.php) is my current source of inspiration. 

What kind of game I will build or if it's any fun is secondary. Currently I'm mostly interested in learning 2D vector graphics & the networking part of game development. Hopefully in the future it could evolve to a game that's actually a little bit fun to play. 



### Architecture

My first backend proof of concept was build in Go, mostly because I wanted to try Go some more. But this might change in the future when I start working on the backend. There are some nice benefits if I decide to run the backend in node.js instead. A lot of game logic can be shared.

- **Backend**: Go (Might change)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS
- **Communication**: WebSockets 


### Progress so far üëá

- Collisions are working and objects can have different masses & elasticity.
- Using a Spatial grid to greatly reduce number of collision checks.
- Every object uses 2D vectors for properties like positions, velocity, acceleration etc.
- Framerate independence - Movement & physics should now behave pretty much the same no matter what framerate the game is running at.

- Added gravity to the game. Each object have a gravitational force proportional to its mass. 
- The player can alter his/her gravitational force to attract/repell close objects. ( I have no idea why you would want to do that, but why not. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )

### Worth looking in to
- Switching to a node backend? Using something like this? https://geckosio.github.io/ It would make it a lot easier to be able to use the same game logic code in both the frontend & backend.
- Node.js snapshot interpolation https://github.com/geckosio/snapshot-interpolation#readme
